{"name":"PMAnalyzer","tagline":"Phenotypic microarray assay analysis for 96-well multi-plate spectrophotometers.","body":"### What is PMAnalyzer?\r\nPMAnalyzer is a command-line software pipeline that performs bacterial growth curve analysis for **M**ulti-phenotype **A**ssay **P**lates (MAPs).\r\n MAPs are 96-well micro-titer plates used to measure biomass formation through a spectrophotometer. Through the use of Python's SciPy and NumPy packages,\r\n PMAnalyzer performs curve-fitting in order to assess lag phase, growth rate, biomass yield, and growth level on each growth curve.\r\n\r\n### How do I install and use it?\r\nPMAnalyzer can be installed and used in any Unix/Linux machine that can run Bash, Perl, Python 2.7+, and Python 3+. You can visit the GitHub repo to find installation information, usage instructions, and sample data and results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to contact me about any questions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
